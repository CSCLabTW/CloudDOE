README FOR DEVELOPERS
=====================

For interested developers, building CloudDOE from source code involves different
requirements as follows.

(1) Java development kit (JDK) and JavaFX runtime environment (jfxrt) are
required. JDK version 1.7 or later is encouraged for better support of
successfully building CloudDOE for users, since jfxrt is evolved in the JDK
release. Otherwise, users should download the correct version of jfxrt package
from Oracle and integrate the package into development environment manually.
(2) Integrated development environment (IDE) tools, e.g., Eclipse, may be
useful for building CloudDOE. Users can import source code into the IDE, or
utilizing Java native command-line tools, i.e., javac and jar, to build
CloudDOE.
