CloudDOE
========

CloudDOE is a user friendly software package to deploy, operate and extend a
MapReduce-based bioinformatics environment, which is collectively denoted as a
CloudDOE Cloud. A CloudDOE Cloud consists of a Hadoop MapReduce computing
framework and specific bioinformatics data analysis tools, e.g., CloudBurst,
CloudBrush, and CloudRS.

CloudDOE is distributed under Apache License 2.0. It consists of a set of BASH
scripts and binary files, and three Java wizards:

1. Deploy wizard provides easy deployment of the Hadoop MapReduce computing
framework for an administrator. This wizard installs JRE 1.6 and Hadoop version
0.20.203, and also starts the Hadoop services automatically.

2. Operate wizard aims at providing users with choices and execution of the
supported MapReduced-based bioinformatics applications from its dashboard.

3. Extend wizard allows a CloudDOE Cloud administrator to extend the
functionalities by maintaining software information of the dashboard, which may
used by the Operate wizard.

Users can read README_USER for prerequisites of CloudDOE. Developers need to read
README_DEVELOPER before compiling and building CloudDOE.
